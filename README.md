# SwiftOT
Operation transform algorithm implemented in Swift

This work is based on the Go implementation found here: https://github.com/mb0/ot.

I extended the implementation with support for tracking cursors. More explanation [here](https://github.com/ZHRhodes/Whaler/blob/master/README.md#collaborative-note-editing).

## How does it work?

See [my other repo](https://github.com/ZHRhodes/Whaler-api/blob/master/README.md#ot) for an overview of the algorithm.
